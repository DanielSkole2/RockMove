An American soul musician by the name of Otis Redding wrote the song "Respect" initially. Few years later Aretha Franklin, a different soul singer, performed and altered "Respect," it became an even larger hit and became her hallmark song in 1967. The two versions have quite distinct musical styles, and certain lyrical alterations have produced divergent themes about human dignity that have been seen as critiques of conventional gender roles.
